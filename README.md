**Midterm Project**

**Sep 19**

- HTML structure done
- Some styling was made
- Tried to apply responsiveness on class Hero, with success

_Challenges:_

- Navbar - Responsiveness - I can't shorten the navbar and to move the menu to the burger menu, I tried to use frameworks but I could not make it.
- Responsiveness. I still have issues on this, I tried to watch some YouTube videos but I think I am getting in the track.

**Sep 20**

Expected to finish all styling of the page and start responsiveness in all platform.
